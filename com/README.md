# AngularJS vs Laravel: What are the differences?
-------------------------------------------------
## AngularJS
<p>uperheroic JavaScript MVW Framework. **AngularJS** lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding; **Laravel**: A PHP Framework For Web Artisans. Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.</p>

AngularJS can be classified as a tool in the "Javascript MVC Frameworks" category, while Laravel is grouped under "Frameworks (Full Stack)".
<br>


"Quick to develop", "Great mvc" and "Powerful" are the key factors why developers consider AngularJS; whereas "Clean architecture", "Growing community" and "Composer friendly" are the primary reasons why Laravel is favored.

AngularJS and Laravel are both open source tools. AngularJS with 59.6K GitHub stars and 28.9K forks on GitHub appears to be more popular than Laravel with 53.4K GitHub stars and 16.4K GitHub forks.

According to the StackShare community, AngularJS has a broader approval, being mentioned in 2799 company stacks & 1860 developers stacks; compared to Laravel, which is listed in 831 company stacks and 773 developer stacks.

## Laravel 
Laravel is primarily being used as the framework that we build some of our internal applications on when we don't need a full CMS. It allows us to rapidly create services that we can integrate or expand on later with ease. I have also consulted on Laravel implementations and provided support for Laravel applications for external clients.

### pros and Cons
* Positive 
	* Laravel utilizes the best possible PHP standards and coding practices.
	* Laravel uses many widely-accepted community libraries and builds upon them, rather than re-inventing everything.
	* Laravel has many components available from the community and is extremely easy to build custom components for, either with custom code or by integrating existing third-party PHP libraries.
	* Laravel is flexible enough to power pretty much any kind of application I can imagine.

* Negative
	* Laravel is not the easiest framework to grasp for new developers (even though it probably IS the best framework for a new developer to learn because it will teach many good, modern development practices).
	* Laravel requires more configuration and glue code than some other frameworks I've used, such as CakePHP. CakePHP relies on convention over configuration, whereas Laravel is more explicit. I think Laravel's way is ultimately more flexible and scalable, even though it's less terse. Perhaps there is room for somewhat of a middle ground.
	* Laravel's community doesn't have the level of contribution of some more widespread PHP frameworks or CMSs, though it has the benefit of being built on Composer and being able to utilize any existing PHP library, so it's not much of an issue.

## ANGULAR
In the year 2009 Google came out with the new technology ‘AngularJS –  an open source client-side web framework’ which addressed the difficulty with single page web development process. AngularJS combines the basic developing principles, patterns, designs etc under a single roof, making the workflow easy for a developer.

Model View Controller(MVC) and dependency injection are scraped together to accelerate web application development. Directives are used here to join the codes in DOM (Document Object Model), where DOM can be accessed only through directives. In order to create private AngularJS directive, you need to write complex syntax. Dependency injection is associated with Angular where a single object supplies the dependency on others. One who is reading the code can easily sort out the modules in relation to the functionalities.

Angular cannot be considered as a library, in fact, it gives the basic structure and frameworks for the construction of an application. Once you want to start a new project, you can set it in the fresh function page without waiting for the libraries to get accessed. Go with the detailed angular vs react case studies to get more insight.

The latest version of AngularJS was released on 7th January 2019 which is labeled as Angular where the AngularJS name remains with the old version.
 

### Pros
* Angular libraries are available, which helps in making of strong template solutions
* Presence of in-built injection subsystem dependency
* It is easier for developers to make a customized document model object(DOM)
* Unit testing can be done by pushing the page into the controller through which we can see the results
* Able to create a good user interface with data binding
* Integrating the components with a Model view is easy
* Extended HTML syntax

### Cons
* Implementing and creating DOM is easy, but issues arise with the performance of DOM elements
* Integrating a third party seems little clumsy
* Debugging may be difficult
* A limited number of resources to routing
* Loading may be slow since there is impeded interactive page elements
* Special concern on security should be implemented for the apps to be safe.
* Needs only lesser lines of codes, but cannot handle very complex queries

## REACT
In the year of 2013, Facebook released the version of JavaScript called ReactJS, which is an open source library for creating flashy user interfaces. For setting up a single page application and apps, with a lesser time period and with faster loading, the described version will be the best choice. Get exposed to Angular vs React case studies to get practical knowledge.

A large amount of reusable components makes the coding part easier. It also supports modular codes that are roughly written. The total architecture is different from that of AngularJS since it uses the MVC framework. A predefined structure cannot be seen here, instead, the developers can update what they wanted to show their clients. React don’t have the MVC framework, yet equipped with the V-view module. Other factors should be created with respect to the requirements.

The Model and Controller layer is absent here and in order to fill the gap, we have the flux to regulate the workflow. Presence of discrete components that are nested inside a loop with reference to the category ease the burden of coding. The total number of writes to DOM is minimum in ReactJS architecture, which is the slowest portion, hence enhances the speed.

The coding is done using JSX, which is an extension of JavaScripts, where each component is recognized as HTML units.

React is more flexible in comparison with Angular, perhaps in terms of predefined libraries that can be compatible with all types of functionalities. A study on Angular vs React makes a better vision from the development side. Increase in flexibility automatically escalates the quantity of tension. Once you are assigned to a project you should build all the resources and the guidance for the same limits to a long extent.

The built-in tools we have in React are boilerplate and linters & time-sinks that creates bit confusion for the freshers. Getting looped in the architecture alone won’t help you to get the products delivered, but need to think beyond the limitations.

### Pros
Code reusing, which makes debugging simple
* Architecture is based on the components which can be easily imported.
* Improved user interface since it is view oriented
* Supports reactive native library
* Updations are faster with the front-end and server-side support
* Global and remote web applications can be made by the developers with server-side analysis
* Supports iOS and Android
* Improved SEO
* Creates machine-readable codes and compound components that compiles with the verified file.
* Abrupt analysis of DOM operation is possible.
* Availability of virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that will ease the use of large databases.
* Virtual DOM hikes the performance percent
* Being JS centric, ReactJS looks simple.
* Needs lengthy codes, but can cope up with very complex functionalities
* Creating UI code is easier with JSX file
* Debugging is easy since one-way data binding is possible.

### Cons
* Tough learning process and complex codes make the developer into a hassle
* Better than addressing as a framework, it is better to call as a library
* Abrupt releasing of updations and new codes creates confusion over the developers where to start researching
* Ever changing architecture puts developers in dilemma.
* The new configuration should be put up when ReactJS joins with the MVC.
* Not a full framework and so combining the UI library into MVC framework needs thorough knowledge in coding



# Laveral And React
---------------------------------------------------
## REACTS
React is great for people who are trying to build complex single page web applications. It is intuitive for developers, encourages modularity through components, and provides a web app this will scale. React may not be suited as well for simple websites or static content. However, this is changing with frameworks like Gatsby which allow you to build static HTML websites using React.

### Pros and Cons
* Positive
	- React is fantastic for building performant user interfaces. Our web app is snappy and great for our customers.
	- React has the philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well which is the view layer of the application. This makes it incredibly intuitive and flexible for developers to use.
	- React has lead the way in being able to write modular and structured code. It is a drastic improvement since the days of spaghetti jQuery code.
	- React has an unmatched community. The amount of tools and libraries available is fantastic, and there plenty of solutions available online for common problems.

* Negative
	- Since React only does one area of the web app (the view layer), this means the developer must patch together the rest of their web app instead of having a single go-to solution. Additional things you need include are routing and state management.
	- React was the leader for building web apps using component architecture. This means that it did get some things wrong, such as making complex classes and having some things difficult to understand. Other libraries have benefited from the learnings of React.
	- The React world moves quickly, and this can mean that code can become outdated quickly. This rapid change can be fatiguing for developers.
### How Do Laravel and React Work?
For finding which is better Laravel or React, let us explore in detail what is laravel and react and how both work across development projects.

### How Does Laravel Work?
Laravel is a web application framework with precise, expressive and well-designed syntax. Laravel leverages a Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This architectural pattern works by breaking down an application into three significant parts:
* Data (Model)
* Interface to see and alter data (View)
* Operations to be executed on data (Controller)

### How Does React Works?
React is an explicit, practical and supple JavaScript library leveraged for developing user interfaces. React uses a declarative method for building apps that make it straightforward to precise programming while concurrently targeting proficiency and agility.

React is an element-based, open-source library that is entirely accountable for the app’s view layer. It builds views for every project-based state, and when the data alters, react apprises and condenses the fitting element or component swiftly. The declarative tactic streamlines debugging and makes the code more prospective.


### Unique Features of Laravel vs React
| React | Laravel |
| : -------- | :------: | -------:|
| Javacript Extention | Template Engine |
| Virtual Document object Model | MVc Architecture |
| One-way Data Binding | Securit |
| Extension | Database migration |

### Benefit f Laravel 
* Laravel accesses multiple libraries, which eases the blending of SaaS APIs within your apps such as Stripe, Mail Chimp, Mandrill, Authorize.net and many more.
* Pre-packaged tools enable tasks when developing apps in Laravel, including user authentication, user authorization, queues and background jobs.
* Laravel backs an extensive set of technologies like PostgreSQL, Redis, MySQL or MariaDB, MemcacheD, and BeanstalkD.

### Benefits of React
* React offers suppleness in creating elements on a page and enables developers to build programmatically constructed HTML grounded on runtime deliberations.
* React leverages JSX, which is HTML templating blended into JavaScript programming. This scenario eases the creation of composite structures, particularly those that diverge based on runtime and collaborative data sets.
* React only enables those parts of the display that have altered, making display updates more effective.


# AngularJS vs CodeIgniter: What are the differences?
Developers describe AngularJS as "Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework". AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding. On the other hand, CodeIgniter is detailed as "A Fully Baked PHP Framework". CodeIgniter is a proven, agile & open PHP web application framework with a small footprint. It is powering the next generation of web apps.


AngularJS can be classified as a tool in the "Javascript MVC Frameworks" category, while CodeIgniter is grouped under "Frameworks (Full Stack)".

"Quick to develop", "Great mvc" and "Powerful" are the key factors why developers consider AngularJS; whereas "Mvc", "Easy setup" and "Open source" are the primary reasons why CodeIgniter is favored.

AngularJS and CodeIgniter are both open source tools. It seems that AngularJS with 59.6K GitHub stars and 28.9K forks on GitHub has more adoption than CodeIgniter with 17.4K GitHub stars and 7.72K GitHub forks.

According to the StackShare community, AngularJS has a broader approval, being mentioned in 2799 company stacks & 1860 developers stacks; compared to CodeIgniter, which is listed in 261 company stacks and 105 developer stacks.

# Codeigniter vs React? What are the difference.
**Codeigniter** is a PHP framework based on the Model-View-Controller development pattern. The MVC programming pattern separates application logic from presentation. The Model contains the data structures, including database queries that insert, delete, update data from your database. The Controller, as the name implies, controls the interactions between models, views, and libraries present in the application. And finally the View will render what the user sees, and that may include Cascading-Style-Sheets, Javascripts, and HTML.

**CodeIgniter** gives you the ability to create organized PHP scripts. It provides additional features, like form and data validation, security and XSS Filtering, session managing, etc. It is simple to use, and you can use it to create any kind of web application you need.

**React** is a Javascript framework that makes it easier to create and design simple views for each state in your application. Unlike CodeIgniter, React is focused primarily on the View part.

**CodeIgniter** needs is a web server in order to function, like IIS (Internet Information Services) , or Apache. React interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) of an HTML application.
